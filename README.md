## Introduction
Machine learning classifiers are a crucial part of data analysis, and choosing the right algorithm can significantly impact the quality of results. In this project, we aim to compare the performance of four popular classification algorithms: KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and SVM. By the end of this project, you will have a clear understanding of how these algorithms work and their effectiveness in various scenarios.
